# AstroNvim Template

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v4+

A template for getting started with [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)

# Note to self.

nvim/lua/plugins/mason.lua

moved from "pyright", "ruff-lsp" to "pyls"

For this to work :Pylspinstall pylsp-ruff

The [tool.ruff] section in pyproject.toml is honored!

I have not been able to make the server section in mason.lua work.

```json
pylsp ={
  settings = {
    pylsp = {
    plugins = {
    },
  },
}
```

I've tried everything.

Also, install mypy.

Will try this config for a bit.. to see if I like it better than pyright.
